    Temporarily suspends a part of the program until further action, typically for internal
    processes.

- methods:
  - java.lang.Thread.sleep()
  - java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos()
  description: >
    Causes the program to pause execution for a specified duration. While paused, no processing is
    taking place.

    Context is required to understand whether this is good or bad. If the program is "busy waiting"
    for another thing to happen (e.g. another Thread to do something or an I/O operation), it may
    cause the program to slow down. In other cases, (e.g. if seen at the root of the Minecraft
    server tick loop), it is probably good news! See the
    [tick loop guide](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop) for more info.

- method: java.lang.Thread.run()
  description: >
    Marks the starting point of execution for a particular part of the program. The first child node
    will usually always be this, just keep expanding!
