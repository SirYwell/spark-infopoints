# spark-infopoints

spark "info points" are extra snippets of information which display alongside well-known/notable call frames in the [spark viewer](https://spark.lucko.me/) (when the user hovers over the **ⓘ** icon).

The source for these descriptions can be found in the various `.yaml` files in this repository.

On each commit, the descriptions are bundled by the scripts in `.build` into a compressed/minified json file, and then published automatically to an endpoint that the viewer can access. :)
